    "First I'm going to give you one class and one function that will be needed for the first couple of problems.  The class called `MoffatPSF` describes a PSF with the following circular profile:\n",
    "$$ I(r) \\propto \\left[1 + (r/r_0)^2\\right]^{-\\beta}.$$\n",
    "Many ground-based PSFs look more like this Moffat function than they do like a Gaussian, so let's use this for our astrometry experiments.  We'll stick with $\\beta=2.5$ When you create a `MoffatPSF`, you give it the  `half_light_radius` $r_{1/2}$ which encloses half of the light, rather than giving it $r_0.$  You also give the coordinates $(x_0,y_0)$ of the center of the star.  All of these arguments we'll assume to be in units of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have made a `MoffatPSF`, you can do a few things with it:\n",
    "* `draw` a picture of the PSF as a 2d image (such that it sums to unity)\n",
    "* `realizeXY` will return you the (x,y) pixel locations of arrival for one observation of the star - including Poisson noise.\n",
    "* `realizeImage` will return you a 2d array that is the pixelized image of the arriving photons.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're curious you can look inside the class to see how it's done - I've used a few non-obvious tricks to make this fast since we want to create a lot of star images. There is a common trick of random-number generation when we are picking photon locations, where we transform a uniform deviate (which computers are good at) using a function that creates some desired distribution instead.  But you don't need to understand this to do the problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there is a function `addBackground` which will add background noise of a chosen level (denoted as $n$ in the lecture notes) to any image."
